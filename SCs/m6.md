# What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.

Principle 2, *new Guideline "Inputs with Assistive Technology"

# Description

There are many input scenarios where assistive technologies interpret user interactions and translate them into user agent directives, such as moving focus to an element or activating an element, without emulating any traditional type of input such as a keyboard or mouse (i.e. no "fake" key events or mouse events are being generated, so cannot be detected/covered by input-specific event handling like `keydown`/`keyup`/`keypress` or `mousedown`/`mouseup`/`mousemove`). Examples include speech control software, gesture recognition to video camera, etc

# Benefits

TODO: Clear information about how the proposal will benefit users, along with justification and evidence of the benefits (this may be a link to a different resource).

# Testability

TODO: Description of how this SC can be tested. This may include manual, automated, or semi-automated mechanisms.

# Techniques

Only rely on high-level, input-agnostic events like `focus`/`blur`/`click`. (Reference IndieUI Events, though this seems inactive at this point?)
