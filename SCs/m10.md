# SC Shortname

Device sensors

# SC Text

All functionality of the content can be operated without requiring specific device sensor information unless the device sensor is essential for the function and not using it would invalidate the activity.

Note 1: device sensors information includes tilt, orientation, proximity.

# What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.

Principle 2, *new* Guideline "Additional sensor inputs"

# Description

Devices may have additional sensors that act as inputs - e.g. tilt/orientation sensors on a mobile/tablet, allowing the user to control something by simply changing the orientation of the device in space. Not all devices have these sensors, OR the device may have the sensors but the user may be unable to operate these sensors (either not at all, or not precisely enough). Functionality must  therefore be implemented in a way that other means are available to activate the function that do not rely on additional sensor input.

## Examples
* After text input in a field, shaking a device shows a dialog offering users to undo the input. A cancel button next to the text field offers the same functionality - activating it reverts to the content (if any) that was shown before the user input replaced it.

# Benefits

Users with disabilities may be unable to perform particular actions impacting on sensors (such as tilting or shaking) because the device may be mounted or users may be physically unable to perform the necessary action. This sucess scriterion ensures that users can still operate all functionality by other means (e.g., touch or voice input). All users benefit from this, for example, users who are temporarily unable to hold and move the device because their hands are occupied with some other activity.

# Testability

This may include manual, automated, or semi-automated mechanisms.

## Procedure
For each function that can activated via additional sensor input:

 1. check that there is an alternative accessibility supported method to activate the function

## Expected Results
 * All checks above are true

# Techniques

Functionality/content must not solely rely on device inputs (e.g. an alternative which does not require the user to manipulate their device/use these device inputs must be available)
