# SC Shortname

Device sensors

# SC Text

All functionality can be operated without requiring specific device sensor information.

Note 1: device sensors information includes tilt, orientation, proximity.

# What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.

Principle 2, *new* Guideline "Additional sensor inputs"

# Description

Devices may have additional sensors that act as inputs - e.g. tilt/orientation sensors on a mobile/tablet, allowing the user to control something by simply changing the orientation of the device in space. Not all devices have these sensors, OR the device may have the sensors but the user may be unable to operate these sensors (either not at all, or not precisely enough).

# Benefits

TODO: Clear information about how the proposal will benefit users, along with justification and evidence of the benefits (this may be a link to a different resource).

Users with disabilities may be unable to perform particular actions impacting on sensors (such as tilting or shaking) because the device may be mounted or users may be physically unable to perform the necessary action. This sucess scriterion ensures that users can still operate all functionality by other means (e.g., touch or voice input). All users benefit from this, for example, users who are temporarily unable to hold and move the device because their hands are occupied with some other activity.

# Testability

TODO: Description of how this SC can be tested. This may include manual, automated, or semi-automated mechanisms.

## Procedure
For each function that can activated via additional sensor input:

 1. check that there is an alternative method to activate the function

## Expected Results
 * All checks above are true

# Techniques

Functionality/content must not solely rely on device inputs (e.g. an alternative which does not require the user to manipulate their device/use these device inputs must be available)
