# What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.

Principle 2, *new* Guideline "Inputs with Assistive Technology"

# Description

TODO: A description of what the intent of the SC is, including what users benefit from the content successfully addressing it (examples are helpful, but not required).

It is not always possible for users to activate arbitrary keys on a keyboard, as these may be reserved for commands to operate an assistive technology. Assistive technologies may intercept key presses before they reach the content (e.g. JavaScript on a webpage), except in very specific circumstances (such as when a text entry field receives focus).

# Benefits

TODO: Clear information about how the proposal will benefit users, along with justification and evidence of the benefits (this may be a link to a different resource).

# Testability

TODO: Description of how this SC can be tested. This may include manual, automated, or semi-automated mechanisms.

# Techniques

Content should not rely on user's ability to arbitrarily press keys (e.g. don't add a `keydown`/`keyup`/`keypress` handler simply to the `<body>`); ensure functionality hangs off of focusable controls; rely on `focus`/`blur`/`click` events; can listen for key presses, but only when focus is in a traditional input/text entry field (as there AT doesn't interfere with key presses) OR use `role="application"` (where you indicate to AT that you will handle all keyboard input directly, suppresses reading keys etc.)
