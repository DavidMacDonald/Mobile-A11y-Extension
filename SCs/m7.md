# What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.

Principle 2

# Description

A generalisation of current 2.1.2 - only difference here is that the way to achieve it is different from plain 2.1.2 where keyboard is the only consideration, so it differs not in the rationale/understanding, but rather only in the technique/how to - prime candidate for merging with 2.1.2 by the WG.

This is the more generalised equivalent to 2.1.1. which covers scenario of inputs with AT. e.g. when using screen reader + keyboard + AT that remaps keys, there may be situations where the author provides a custom key to exit a particular dialog/input/widget, but that specific key is intercepted by AT. in the touch + AT scenario, the author may have built something that reacts specifically to a custom key or listens for a particular element receiving focus, but touch+AT doesn't allow arbitrary keys being pressed AND doesn't always fire focus (see for instance Android 6/Chrome/Talkback https://patrickhlauke.github.io/touch/tests/results/#mobile-tablet-touchscreen-assistive-technology-events)

# Benefits

TODO: Clear information about how the proposal will benefit users, along with justification and evidence of the benefits (this may be a link to a different resource).

# Testability

TODO: Description of how this SC can be tested. This may include manual, automated, or semi-automated mechanisms.

# Techniques

Do not trap focus and then require custom/non-standard methods to leave a particular widget (e.g. a custom key to be pressed); in the case of dialogs or similar, provide an explicit focusable control to return to normal focus operation (i.e. to close the dialog and return to the underlying page)

[Editorial comment: Detlev's additional point - still not sure there can be a genuine pointer trap that is not something that freezes the app entirely - at least the 4 finger tap to movce focus to start or end or reverse swiping seem to work most of the time - would be good to document cases]
