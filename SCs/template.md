# SC Shortname

This is the short name for the SC (e.g. "Non-text Content" is the short name for SC 1.1.1 in WCAG 2.0)

# SC Text

This is the text of the Success Criterion.

If suggesting a wording change to an existing success criteria, write the complete SC text and then follow that with a version which indicates the changes by surrounding new text with "@@". For example (just an example):

## Current:

1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum): The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for the following: (Level AA)

## Proposed:

1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum): The visual presentation of @@text, images of text, and icons@@ has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for the following: (Level @@A@@).

# Suggestion for Priority Level (A/AA/AAA)

# Related Glossary additions or changes

Details of any suggested glossary definitions or changes.

# What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.

A simple answer, such as "Principle 1, Guideline 1.4".

If proposing a new Guideline, indicate the Principle.

# Description

A description of what the intent of the SC is, including what users benefit from the content successfully addressing it (examples are helpful, but not required).

# Benefits

Clear information about how the proposal will benefit users, along with justification and evidence of the benefits (this may be a link to a different resource).

# Testability

Description of how this SC can be tested. This may include manual, automated, or semi-automated mechanisms.

# Techniques

Possible technique titles which could be used to satisfy the SC (just the titles). If existing techniques will help satisfy the SC these can be identified here also.

For example, a simple change to 1.4.3 (as in the above example), might result in a response like this:

1. All existing techniques for 1.4.3
2. New technique: Providing sufficient contrast for icons
