# SC Shortname

Pointer

# SC Text

All functionality can be operated with pointer inputs. If functionality requires text entry, a mechanism is available for users to enter the text using pointer inputs (for instance, through an on-screen keyboard).

Note 1: in most cases, the on-screen keyboard will already be provided by the operating system or user agent.

Pointer inputs: input devices that can target a specific coordinate (or set of coordinates) on a screen, such as a mouse, pen, or touch contact. (modified slightly from https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/#glossary)

# What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.

Principle 2, *new* Guideline "Pointer Accessible"

# Description

TODO: A description of what the intent of the SC is, including what users benefit from the content successfully addressing it (examples are helpful, but not required).

WCAG 2.0 currently takes it for granted that content will be designed/built to work with pointer inputs (generally, mouse). This is not always a given, and for completeness should be added. Examples are:

* Pop-up windows that can only be closed / dismissed via the keyboard
* Situations where a physical keyboard is not present but  text input is required. Applications may not automatically trigger the display of an on-screen virtual keyboard
* Situations where important functionality may only be displayed when an element is focused via the keyboard 

Needs cautious wording to ensure we're not requiring authors to build their own on-screen keyboards etc, probably through use of "a mechanism is available" language which would then cover situations where the OS/UA themselves provide on-screen keyboards (see discussion https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-mobile-a11y-tf/2016Jul/0014.html)

# Benefits

TODO: Clear information about how the proposal will benefit users, along with justification and evidence of the benefits (this may be a link to a different resource).

Making sure that all functionality can be used via pointer input (mouse, stylus, touch) helps users of devices without keyboard. When applications support keyboard commands for specific functions, this success criterion ensures that there are equivalent means to activate these functions via pointer input.

# Testability

TODO: Description of how this SC can be tested. This may include manual, automated, or semi-automated mechanisms.

Check if all functions designed for keyboard input (e.g. functions detecting specific key presses) can also be activated via pointer (this is usually the case if device independent event handler like onclick, onfocus or onblur have been used).

# Techniques

TODO: Possible technique titles which could be used to satisfy the SC (just the titles). If existing techniques will help satisfy the SC these can be identified here also.

* Use device independent input events 
* could be a variant of "SCR35: Making actions keyboard accessible by using the onclick event of anchors and buttons" - 
(dit suggeston: "SCR35: Making actions both keyboard and pointer accessible by using the onclick event of anchors and buttons")
