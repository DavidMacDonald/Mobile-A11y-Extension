# SC Shortname

Pointer

# SC Text

All functionality can be operated with pointer inputs. If functionality requires text entry, a mechanism is available for users to enter the text using pointer inputs (for instance, through an on-screen keyboard).

Note 1: in most cases, the on-screen keyboard will already be provided by the operating system or user agent.

Pointer inputs: input devices that can target a specific coordinate (or set of coordinates) on a screen, such as a mouse, pen, or touch contact. (modified slightly from https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/#glossary)

# What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.

Principle 2, *new* Guideline "Pointer Accessible"

# Description

TODO: A description of what the intent of the SC is, including what users benefit from the content successfully addressing it (examples are helpful, but not required).

WCAG 2.0 currently silently assumes that of course content will be designed/built to work with pointer inputs (generally, mouse); this is not always a given, and for completeness should be added. Needs cautious wording to ensure we're not requiring authors to build their own on-screen keyboards etc, probably through use of "a mechanism is available" language which would then cover situations where the OS/UA themselves provide on-screen keyboards (see discussion https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-mobile-a11y-tf/2016Jul/0014.html)

# Benefits

TODO: Clear information about how the proposal will benefit users, along with justification and evidence of the benefits (this may be a link to a different resource).

# Testability

TODO: Description of how this SC can be tested. This may include manual, automated, or semi-automated mechanisms.

# Techniques

TODO: Possible technique titles which could be used to satisfy the SC (just the titles). If existing techniques will help satisfy the SC these can be identified here also.

For example, a simple change to 1.4.3 (as in the above example), might result in a response like this:

1. All existing techniques for 1.4.3
2. New technique: Providing sufficient contrast for icons
